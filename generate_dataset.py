# Slice Pizza Knowledge

Slice Pizza is a fictional neighborhood pizzeria created for a study project. It was founded in 2018 by a small team of cooks who loved thin dough and simple pizza recipes. The name came from the idea of testing recipes like a friendly kitchen experiment. Slice Pizza serves thin-crust pizzas with homemade tomato sauce and a friendly atmosphere.

The pizzeria offers eight pizzas: Margherita, Pepperoni, Four Cheese, Chicken Catupiry, Portuguese, Vegetarian, Mushroom, and Chocolate. Each pizza can be ordered whole or by the slice. Drinks include Coke, Sprite, and Guarana. The Chocolate pizza is the dessert option. Slice Pizza offers local delivery in this fictional ordering simulation.

Pizza is a baked dish made with dough, sauce, cheese, and toppings. Pizza dough is the base, usually made with flour, water, yeast, and salt. Tomato sauce is spread over the dough before cheese and toppings are added. Mozzarella is a soft cheese that melts well and is used on most pizzas. Basil is an aromatic herb used on Margherita pizza. Oregano is a dried herb commonly sprinkled on pizza. A topping is any ingredient placed on top of a pizza, such as cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, or basil. Thin crust is pizza dough stretched into a lighter and crispier base.
